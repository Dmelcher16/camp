## Contributors & Roles:

 - Giancarlo Brida (Front End)
 - Rob Kellen (Back End)

## Application Name: Camp K-9

## Overview:
This application allows a dog trainer to track the progress of various training focuses for each individual dog in their training regimen.  By maintaining the progress of each dog’s training focus the trainer is able to show tangible data to the dog owner after each training session.

## User Story:
I would like to be able to log relevant information in the training of a dog. I want to be able to input the skill and the measurements for that skill and track these measurements over time. After I input the data I would like to be able to easily view the pets progress over time with easily understandable charts/graphs. I would like to have a list of all dogs that I am currently training and be able to select them each individually. Then I would like to be able to export a PDF file that I can send to the dogs owner to show them the progress made.
