          Training your dogs can be difficult especially in the current climate
          of the world. With all the stress and anxiety of this day and age you
          will certainly have a handful of action thrown at you. Neglect of
          other secondary responsibilities can be a subconscious side effect of
          stress, resulting in unwanted circumstances. God forbid you neglect
          your pets and are uninformed about their well being. Camp K-9 is here
          to help!

          Camp K-9 is an authenticated website where people can check their dogs
          into a specified kennel and watch their training progression as time
          goes on. There is no limit to the amount of dogs added to one's
          kennel. The more the merrier! The owner of the dogs enters the dogâ€™s
          information and then the desired training focus. Subsequently, the
          owner is taken to a page where they can view their dogs progressions
          from the last time it was updated.
